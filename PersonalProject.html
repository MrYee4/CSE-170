  <h2>What is your style?</h2>
  
    <p>
     My style is very lone wolf. I like to do things on my own and then ask for feedback. I recharge with my alone time and like to be alone to my thoughts. 
      This helps me to think clearly and come up solutions. Its not a good way to work in a team so I am trying to be more open in group settings and 
      collaborations.
    </p>
  
  <h2>When do you like people to approach you and how?</h2>
    <p>
     I like when people approach me when I am not deep in thought or working on a project when its not a good stopping spot. The best way is to send 
      me a message orwalk up to me asking if its a good time and I will let them know. Most times it is okay and I would love to talk to them but 
      there are times when I am trying to really focus on something and its hard for me to say its not a good time and go right back into focusing.
    </p>
  <h2>What do you value?</h2>
    <p>
     I value honesty. I like it when people are honest and not trying to suck up to someone making their real oppinioin impossible to determine. 
      This make people do things they actually don't want to do and give ideas they don't believe in. I really respect when someone gives their 
      true oppinion in a grooup or personal setting when it goes against the general populus and do it in a respectfull way.
