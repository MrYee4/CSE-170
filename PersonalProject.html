  <h1>Spencer Nettles' Personal Project</h1>
  
  <h2>What is your style?</h2>
  
    <p>
     My style is very lone wolf. I like to do things on my own and then ask for feedback. I recharge with my alone time and like to be alone to my thoughts. 
      This helps me to think clearly and come up solutions. Its not a good way to work in a team so I am trying to be more open in group settings and 
      collaborations.
    </p>
  
  <h2>When do you like people to approach you and how?</h2>
    <p>
     I like when people approach me when I am not deep in thought or working on a project when its not a good stopping spot. The best way is to send 
      me a message orwalk up to me asking if its a good time and I will let them know. Most times it is okay and I would love to talk to them but 
      there are times when I am trying to really focus on something and its hard for me to say its not a good time and go right back into focusing.
    </p>
  <h2>What do you value?</h2>
    <p>
     I value honesty. I like it when people are honest and not trying to suck up to someone making their real oppinioin impossible to determine. 
      This make people do things they actually don't want to do and give ideas they don't believe in. I really respect when someone gives their 
      true oppinion in a grooup or personal setting when it goes against the general populus and do it in a respectfull way.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How do you like people to communicate with you?</h2>
    <p>
     I like people to be honest with me. You can be very direct and give feedback. I can take this and improve because others can see things I can't. 
      I think this is the best because this is why teams are so good. They can brainstorm and come up with ideas that are better for everyone than one person.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How do you make decisions?</h2>
    <p>
     I tend to make decisions based on feeling and less logic. I tend to trust my gut feeling, but this can be a good or bad thing. This can lead to decisions 
      I want rather than whats best. I have been trying to be more logical with my decision making but I tend to get hooked on one thing and try and learn all 
      I can about it and then do it until something else catches my attention and I repeat the cycle.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How can people help you?</h2>
    <p>
     People can help me stay grounded in facts and oppinons rather than my feelings. It helps to collabroate with others so they can keep you grounded in facts 
      and reality. This can help me stay on a good path or direction and keep me grounded. 
    </p>
  
  <h2>What will you not tolerate in others?</h2>
    <p>
     I wont tolerate lying. I think its just detrimental to both people. It misleads people and harms whatever project they are working on and makes that person 
      less trustworthy and makes it hard to repair that trust.
