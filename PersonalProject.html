  <h2>What is your style?</h2>
  
    <p>
     My style is very lone wolf. I like to do things on my own and then ask for feedback. I recharge with my alone time and like to be alone to my thoughts. 
      This helps me to think clearly and come up solutions. Its not a good way to work in a team so I am trying to be more open in group settings and 
      collaborations.
