  <h2>My Style</h2>
 
    <p>
      * I like to do things on my own and then seek help and advice when needed<br><br>
      * I recharge by being alone with my thoughts or with a few of my closest friends. This allows me to recharge and think clearly through the 
      situations and problems in my life<br><br>
      * The best way to do things is to really think about it first and come up with a solid plan. When that plan is made then execute it.<br><br>
      * My attention to detail is what makes me stand out in the work place. I like to find the balance between quakity and quantity by doing 
       a realy good job but not taking forever to do it.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How best to communicate with me</h2>
    <p>
      * If its in a email or document I preffer if it was short and sweet. Tell me what I need to know in the fastest way possible. This helps me
      know what you want and how I can help<br><br>
      * Approach me as a friend. I like talking to my friends and value their input, so approach me as someone you respect and aren't afraid to
      disagree with in a respectful way.<br><br>
      * Don't interupt when im busy with something. When you want to talk just ask. If its a good time, I would love to talk to you. But if I am
      deep in a project and cant loose my train of thought I'll tell you thats its not right now and when I get a break I'll come to you.
    </p>
  
  <h2>What I value</h2>
    <p>
      * Honesty, I value honesty and when people take responsibility for their actions. This shows to me that they are ready to move forward
      and work hard.<br><br>
      * Trust, When people trust me and I trust them we have a great work relationship. I can focus on my work and now worry about theirs and vice versa.
       This is also why I value honesty because that's what builds my trust in someone.<br><br>
      * Effeciency, I value people that can do a good job and get teh job done fast. It makes the work we do go by so much smoother and faster. Thats why
       I try and be as effecient as possible.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How do you like people to communicate with you?</h2>
    <p>
     I like people to be honest with me. You can be very direct and give feedback. I can take this and improve because others can see things I can't. 
      I think this is the best because this is why teams are so good. They can brainstorm and come up with ideas that are better for everyone than one person.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How do you make decisions?</h2>
    <p>
     I tend to make decisions based on feeling and less logic. I tend to trust my gut feeling, but this can be a good or bad thing. This can lead to decisions 
      I want rather than whats best. I have been trying to be more logical with my decision making but I tend to get hooked on one thing and try and learn all 
      I can about it and then do it until something else catches my attention and I repeat the cycle.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How can people help you?</h2>
    <p>
     People can help me stay grounded in facts and oppinons rather than my feelings. It helps to collabroate with others so they can keep you grounded in facts 
      and reality. This can help me stay on a good path or direction and keep me grounded. 
    </p>
  
  <h2>What I don't have patience for</h2>
    <p>
      * Lying, I don't have patience for lying. It ruins trust and shows me who is and isn't honest. I don't always like to rely on other but when I
       need to I will always choose those I think are trustworthy.<br><br>
      * Sloppy workers, I want a job to be done right in the work force so if people do a bad job I will rather send someone that does a good job. 
       Unless they are learning and trying. I always respect those that are trying to imrpove their craft because it shows dedication.
