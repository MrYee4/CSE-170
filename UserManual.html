  <h1>Spencer Nettles' User Manual</h1>
  
  <h2>My Style</h2>
 
    <p>
      * I like to do things on my own and then seek help and advice when needed<br><br>
      * I recharge by being alone with my thoughts or with a few of my closest friends. This allows me to recharge and think clearly through the 
      situations and problems in my life<br><br>
      * The best way to do things is to really think about it first and come up with a solid plan. When that plan is made then execute it.<br><br>
      * My attention to detail is what makes me stand out in the work place. I like to find the balance between quakity and quantity by doing 
       a realy good job but not taking forever to do it.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How best to communicate with me</h2>
    <p>
      * If its in a email or document I preffer if it was short and sweet. Tell me what I need to know in the fastest way possible. This helps me
      know what you want and how I can help<br><br>
      * Approach me as a friend. I like talking to my friends and value their input, so approach me as someone you respect and aren't afraid to
      disagree with in a respectful way.<br><br>
      * Don't interupt when im busy with something. When you want to talk just ask. If its a good time, I would love to talk to you. But if I am
      deep in a project and cant loose my train of thought I'll tell you thats its not right now and when I get a break I'll come to you.
    </p>
  
  <h2>What I value</h2>
    <p>
      * Honesty, I value honesty and when people take responsibility for their actions. This shows to me that they are ready to move forward
      and work hard.<br><br>
      * Trust, When people trust me and I trust them we have a great work relationship. I can focus on my work and now worry about theirs and vice versa.
       This is also why I value honesty because that's what builds my trust in someone.<br><br>
      * Effeciency, I value people that can do a good job and get teh job done fast. It makes the work we do go by so much smoother and faster. Thats why
       I try and be as effecient as possible.
    </p>

  <h2>What people misunderstand about me</h2>
    <p>
     I tend to make decisions based on feeling and less logic. I tend to trust my gut feeling, but this can be a good or bad thing. This can lead to decisions 
      I want rather than whats best. I have been trying to be more logical with my decision making but I tend to get hooked on one thing and try and learn all 
      I can about it and then do it until something else catches my attention and I repeat the cycle.
    </p>
  
  <h2>How to help me</h2>
    <p>
      * Let me know if I am wrong. I make plenty of mistakes so if you catch one let me know.<br><br>
      * If you dont aggree with what I am doing or the ideas I have let me know. I realy respect when people give ideas or oppinions contrary to the higher ups.
      If they do it in a respectful way it shows they truley care about the job and don't just suck up to managment.<br><br>
      * Be patient with me. Sometimes it takes a while for me to understand a concept you are trying to convey but when I get it, I get it. So don't get
      frustrated if I don't understand what you are trying to say right away.
    </p>
  
  <h2>What I don't have patience for</h2>
    <p>
      * Lying, I don't have patience for lying. It ruins trust and shows me who is and isn't honest. I don't always like to rely on other but when I
       need to I will always choose those I think are trustworthy.<br><br>
      * Sloppy workers, I want a job to be done right in the work force so if people do a bad job I will rather send someone that does a good job. 
       Unless they are learning and trying. I always respect those that are trying to imrpove their craft because it shows dedication.
    </p>
